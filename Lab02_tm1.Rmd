library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
drivers <- read_csv("data/bad-drivers.csv")
names(drivers)[2] <-"DriverNum"
names(drivers)[3] <-"Speeding"
names(drivers)[4] <-"Alcohol"
names(drivers)[5] <-"Distraction"
names(drivers)[6] <-"History"
names(drivers)[7] <-"CIP"
names(drivers)[8] <-"Loss"

names(drivers)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(drivers)
dim(drivers)
head(drivers)
vars_to_use <- c("DriverNum" ,"Speeding","Alcohol","Distraction","History","Loss" ,"CIP")
ggpairs(drivers%>%select(vars_to_use))
ggplot(data = drivers, mapping = aes(x = "State", y = "CIP" )) +
  geom_col()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
